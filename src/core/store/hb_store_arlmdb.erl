%%% @doc A read-only store over an LMDB 1.0 file published on Arweave: the
%%% data of a transaction, read in place with byte-range requests. The file
%%% is never downloaded and never opened with LMDB.
%%%
%%% The store knows the file's layout alone, and reads it from the file.
%%% A main database in LMDB's default mode -- keys with values -- holds
%%% paths as `hb_store_lmdb' writes them: a value is a `group' marker, a
%%% `link:' to another path, or the value itself. Such a file is served as
%%% that store serves its own, read-only: reads follow links and answer a
%%% group with its children's values, lists answer with a group's children,
%%% and `resolve' follows the links in a path. A main database in DUP mode
%%% (`MDB_DUPSORT bor MDB_DUPFIXED') -- fixed-width keys, each holding a
%%% sorted set of fixed-width duplicate values -- takes a request that is
%%% a key, or a key followed by value bits:
%%% ```
%%%     read:   The first value under the key that begins with the value
%%%             bits, or a proven miss.
%%%     list:   The values under the key, from the one `from' gives, in
%%%             the `direction' requested, up to the `limit'. A batch is
%%%             the rest of the first leaf read, and reads into the next
%%%             leaf only while the first holds nothing past the value the
%%%             list starts from. A request shorter than the key width
%%%             lists the keys beginning with it instead.
%%%     type:   `composite' for a key, `simple' for a key and value bits
%%%             that a read finds.
%%% '''
%%% A file holding a single key serves that key's values, and its requests
%%% leave the key out: they are value bits. A store definition with
%%% `return-row' asks for rows instead: a request is any leading bits of a
%%% row -- its key followed by its value -- and reads and lists answer with
%%% whole rows, a list's `from' continuing the request's bits. That serves
%%% an artifact whose builder let a field straddle the key boundary, as the
%%% match index below did.
%%%
%%% No artifact's geometry lives here. The keys a file serves, the bits a
%%% key seeks and the message a value answers with belong to the store
%%% definition, through the store manager's pipeline -- `prefix', `to-key',
%%% `from-key' and `from-value', described in `hb_store' -- so a definition
%%% alone serves any file of either mode. The tests read three. A published
%%% `hb_store_lmdb' layout needs nothing but its root:

%%% The file is LMDB 1.0 (`MDB_DATA_VERSION' 3, little-endian), of pages
%%% between 256 bytes and 64 KiB, the size the meta page records. Each page
%%% opens with a 24 byte header: the page number and the LMDB internal
%%% transaction as 64 bit ints, then `pad', `flags', `lower', and `upper' as
%%% 16 bit integers. The node pointer array follows the header, and its
%%% entries -- like `lower' and `upper' -- are relative to the end of the
%%% header. The meta pages are pages 0 and 1; the one with the higher
%%% transaction ID wins. The main database is in the default mode or in DUP
%%% mode. Its branch pages hold keys as node keys, the first node of each
%%% standing for the least key. In the default mode a leaf node holds a
%%% value in the node's data, or `F_BIGDATA' with the value on overflow
%%% pages from the page the data numbers. In DUP mode each leaf node holds
%%% a key's duplicate set in one of three forms: a single item as the
%%% node's data; an `F_DUPDATA' sub-page, a whole fixed-width page image in
%%% the node's data; or an `F_SUBDATA' sub-database, whose 48 byte record
%%% the node holds and whose tree the store descends -- branch pages whose
%%% keys are items, and `P_LEAF2' leaves holding no nodes and no slot array,
%%% where item `I' is the `pad' bytes at page offset `24 + I * pad' and
%%% `lower bsr 1' items fill the page, ascending strictly.
%%%
%%% Fetched chunks are retained in the stores under the `chunk-store' key
%%% of the store definition, defaulting to a volatile store that expires
%%% every five minutes; `[]' retains nothing. Published files are
%%% defragmented -- the first chunk holds the meta pages and main root,
%%% branch pages cluster, and leaves follow in key order -- so the chunks a
%%% read retains answer most of the reads that follow it.
%%%
%%% Every layout outside this contract is refused with a distinct error,
%%% never treated as a miss, and a failed byte-range fetch surfaces as
%%% `{error, {unavailable, ...}}': a proven miss requires a successfully
